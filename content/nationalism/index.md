It's impossible to make sense of Canadian culture without talking about the United States. The vast majority of our media comes from the US, most of the platforms we use for commerce or communication are American owned, and our politics are a desaturated reflection of American politics. Growing up, comparison to the US was exceedingly common. I vividly remember in social studies being taught our contrasting approaches to multiculturalism, the melting pot versus the mosaic.

The melting pot was said to be the American dream of integration or assimilation. The goal of living in the US was to become An American and to achieve American notions of success. The Canadian notion of the mosaic was thought to be a less totalizing concept of multiculturalism, presenting a counterpoint to assimilation. These ideas, assimilation and multiculturalism, are hard to measure and the comparison strikes me as aspirational. Canada looks at America, sees something very similar, and invents a distinction that serves the project of trying to build a nation that is meaningfully different.

Canada seems to need an aspirational category for our approach to immigration. Setting aside that we're adjacent to government that's currently enacting a horrific program of mass deportation, it feels like most of us can't look directly at border politics. We seem to want to provide lip service to the idea of a multicultural and pluralist society, but mainstream liberal conversation never seems to engage with the realities of a country predicated on Colonial occupation and resource extraction. Half of the world's mining companies are based here! Hundreds of millions of dollars fund the C-IRG, a division of the RCMP that primarily brutalizes Indigenous people on behalf of resource extraction projects on Indigenous land. Our Temporary Foreign Workers program is precarious, prone to abuse, and guarantees a class of migrants that can can work here without ever having a road to citizenship. Canadian multiculturalism, against this backdrop, reads as cope, yet another way to say "well at least we're not American". Aim a little fucking higher!

This inability to engage with the actual world around us mirrors progressive American attitudes towards immigration. From 2017 to 2021, the American press had a steady drumbeat of reporting covering the horrors of the American systems of deportation and detentions. With the change in regime to the Biden administration, that coverage vanished. And it's not like the tools of mass deportation weren't being further developed and employed under Biden! The expansion of ICE, being used now to execute Trump's program of mass deportation, has enjoyed bipartisan support since its founding in 2003.

And again I'm falling into the trap, using the US to try to explain Canada.
