## Goals

This routine was put together to satisfy a couple of goals:
- Do any stretching at all
- Put stretching into my the break periods of my routine
- Develop flexibility with the least reasonable effort.

## Assumptions

I built the routine based on some synthesis Movement By David has done, who suggests that about 5 total minutes per original stretch a week, so I've opted for 2 sets of 30 seconds for stretches, with a one minute rest, assume this stretch and rest duration for all stretches. 2 sets for any arm or leg specific stretches assumes stretching both, of course.
